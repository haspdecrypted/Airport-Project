# ðŸ›«Airport-Project

In this project we will be analyzing some data files namely,
- Final_airlines
- routes.dat
- airports_mod.dat

Then we need to create three tables for each data set we have in the below given schema

<h4> Airport Table </h4>

|Columns   |Explanation   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|Airport ID   | Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airport.  |
| Name  |  Name of airport. May or may not contain the City name. |
| City  |  Main city served by airport. May be spelled differently from Name. |
| Country  |  Country or territory where airport is located. |
| IATA/FAA | 3-letter FAA code, for airports located in Country "United States of America".3-letter IATA code, for all other airports. Blank if not assigned.|
|  ICAO |  4-letter ICAO code. Blank if not assigned. |
| Latitude  | Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits. Negative is South, positive is North.  |
| Longitude  | Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits. Negative is West, positive is East.  |
| Altitude  | In feet.  |
| Timezone  |  Hours offset from UTC. Fractional hours are expressed as decimals, eg. India is 5.5. |
| DST  |  Daylight savings time. One of E (Europe), A (US/Canada), S (South America), O (Australia), Z (New Zealand), N (None) or U (Unknown). See also: Help: Time |
|Tz    |  Database time Timezone in "tz" (Olson) format, eg. "America/Los_Angeles". zone.|

<h4> Air lines Table </h4>

| Columns  | Explanation   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  Airline | Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airline. ID   |
| Name  | Name of the airline.  |
| Alias   | Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as "ANA".   |
| IATA  | 2-letter IATA code, if available  |
| ICAO  | 3-letter ICAO code, if available.   |
| Callsign  | Airline callsign.  |
| Country  | Country or territory where airline is incorporated.  |
| Active  | "Y" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, "N" if it is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg. Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as "Y".  |
